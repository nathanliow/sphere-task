      which Sphere-Enabled Services may be offered to End Users. As such,
      any failure by a User to properly extend and apply equivalent
      compliance measures to its own Services, as agreed to previously,
      could potentially cause irreparable damage to Sphere. By proceeding,
      User agrees to provide to bear full legal responsibility for the End 
      Users they service. This responsibility is elaborated in §4.4.  
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>4.4. Remediation </strong></p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      You will be fully responsible for any and all liability, losses, damages or
      claims that arise from or relate to unauthorized access or use of your
      Sphere Account, violation of these Terms, or non-compliance with
      applicable laws. Sphere maintains full discretion regarding remedies or
      actions taken in response to any such breaches, without requiring advance
      notice. If a breach of these Terms involves coordinated efforts by you and
      other Sphere Users, you and those parties may be jointly and severally liable
      for resulting monetary, equitable or any other damages incurred by Sphere
      and its Affiliates. Sphere's election to pursue any particular legal or
      equitable remedy for actual or threatened violations will not act as a waiver
      of Sphere's other rights or remedies, nor preclude Sphere from pursuing
      multiple or alternative remedies simultaneously or in the future. Sphere
      makes no guarantee to take action in response to violations, but retains full
      discretion to do so as it deems appropriate.

      assistance, network maintenance, and incident response as necessary and
      detailed in the associated <strong>Sphere Master Service Agreement</strong> (“<strong>MSA</strong>”), and

      Merchant offerings of Sphere Services, in this case Sphere-Enabled
      Services, to third-party End Users. While Sphere will endeavor to remediate
      direct disruptions to its infrastructure per the MSA/SLA, it cannot oversee
      nor is legally responsible for independent applications, platforms or
      systems operated by Merchant in connecting End Users to Sphere Services.
      Sphere will abide by the agreements detailed in the MSA/SLA to provide
      commercially reasonable efforts, to the best of its ability and subject to the

    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>8.1. Agreement to Arbitration</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      For all disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or your relationship
      with Sphere (collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”), you agree to binding arbitration
      (“<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”). This includes Claims between us, you, or related
      third parties. You acknowledge that arbitration is a mandatory substitute for
      litigation that offers distinct advantages in both efficiency and cost when
      resolving disputes. By agreeing to arbitrate all Claims according to this
      Section, you acknowledge and agree without limitation that arbitration
      generally involves a limited discovery process, that issues are decided by a
      neutral third-party arbitrator rather than a judge or jury, and that the
      arbitrator's award is binding, with limited rights to appeal. This Arbitration
      Agreement shall apply to all Claims between you, any related third parties
      involved in any aspect of your Sphere account or activities, and Sphere, and
      its current and former affiliates, subsidiaries, employees and agents,
      regardless of whether the Claims arose in the past, present or future. The
      Claims subject to this Arbitration Agreement include without limitation all
      federal and state statutory, common law and equitable Claims.

    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>8.2. Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Action Rights</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      BY PROCEEDING YOU AGREE TO THIS BINDING ARBITRATION
      AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS
      IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL. SIMILARLY, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE
      RIGHT TO PURSUE A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE
      CLAIMS. YOU AGREE TO FOREGO THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY AND THE
      RIGHT TO APPEAL. ALL CLAIMS, FINDINGS, AND SETTLEMENT UNDER
      THIS BINDING ARBITRATION SHALL BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. YOUR
      ACCEPTANCE AND CONTINUED USE OF SPHERE'S SERVICES SHALL BE
      PERMANENTLY CONSTRUED AS CONSENT TO AND PARTICIPATION IN
      THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROCESS. BY UTILIZING, ACCESSING OR
      INTERACTING WITH SPHERE IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER, YOU ARE
      EXPLICITLY AND INHERENTLY AGREEING TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL
      DISPUTES, CLAIMS OR CONTROVERSIES AGAINST SPHERE THROUGH
      BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH HEREIN.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>8.3. Arbitration Process</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      Before initiating arbitration for a dispute not amicably resolved, the parties
      will first attempt mediation administered by the American Arbitration
      Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) in Delaware, or a mutually agreed location. The parties
      will mutually select the mediator or if unable, the AAA will select one. If
      mediation is unsuccessful within 60 days, the dispute will proceed to
      binding arbitration described below. Notwithstanding, a party may arbitrate
      to comply with limitation periods. All Claims will be resolved exclusively
      through binding individual arbitration administered by the AAA under its
      applicable Rules, limiting discovery. A hearing will occur in the district of
      your residence. The arbitrator will apply substantive Delaware law
      consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (“<strong>FAA</strong>”). Privileges recognized at
      law will be honored. The arbitrator’s award is final except as allowed by law.
      Declaratory and injunctive relief is limited to the requesting party.
      Precedential effects do not extend to non-parties. If any portion is invalid,
      the remainder survives. The FAA governs. Issues of scope/enforceability
      interpretation are determined by Delaware/federal courts. 
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>8.4. Right to Reject</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      You may reject this Arbitration Agreement by written notice to Sphere
      within 30 days of account registration. Rejection does not affect other
      agreements. Notices must include name, address, email, phone. Claims
      properly filed in small claims court are excluded.  
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>8.3. Arbitration Proces</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      These Terms and your access/use are governed by Delaware law, without regard 
      to conflicts principles. Non-arbitrable disputes will be resolved
      exclusively in Delaware and in federal courts if pertinent.

    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>9.1. Notices and Communication</strong> </p>

      Any information that is deemed to be relevant to a User, as determined by
      the law, our Affiliates, and at the discretion of Sphere (“<strong>Notice”,
      “Communication</strong>"), shall be sent via e-mail or an otherwise previously
      agreed upon form of electronic communication. To ensure receipt, you must
      notify Sphere if there are any changes in your previous communications
      channel. You agree that Sphere’s verifiable attempt at delivery will be
      considered valid notice under law, even if circumstances outside of our
      control, such as a sudden and not imparted change in delivery address has
      been enacted by you or your service providers. We retain the right to
      temporarily suspend your Sphere Account if a Notice is undeliverable.

    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>9.2. Adaptation</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      If a court within the state of Delaware finds any part of this Agreement
      cannot be enforced, that part will be modified to reflect the original intent
      as much as possible, while the rest of the Agreement remains effective.  
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>9.3. Force Majeure</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      You acknowledge and agree that Sphere cannot be held responsible for a
      failure to fulfill their duties if unforeseen events beyond our control prevent
      us from doing so. This includes but is not limited to: earthquake, flood, fire,
      storm, pandemic, epidemic, or other natural disaster, act of God, labor
      controversy or threat thereof, civil disturbance or commotion, disruption of
      the public markets, war or armed conflict, or the inability to obtain sufficient
      material, supplies, labor, transportation, power, or other essential
      commodity or service required in the conduct of its business, including
      internet access, or any change in or the adoption of any law, ordinance, rule,

      provisions relating to intellectual property, confidentiality, warranties and
      disclaimers, limitation of liability, disputes, governing law, compliance with
      laws, and miscellaneous matters, shall survive and continue to bind the
      parties, their successors, executors, heirs, representatives and permitted 
      assigns. Additionally, the following provisions shall explicitly survive
      termination: (i) Your payment obligations for any fees or costs accrued prior
      to termination; (ii) Sphere's right to suspend or terminate, including and
      especially in the future, your access for any past violations; (iii) mutual
      obligations to resolve any Claims through binding arbitration as described

      third-party claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage, action, proceeding,
      judgment, settlement, penalty, fine, cost, or expense (including reasonable

    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      To the extent there is any conflict or inconsistency between the modules of 
      the Terms and other outstanding agreements, such conflict or inconsistency
      shall be resolved in the following order of precedence, unless a term or

      as taking precedence over a document of higher precedence: Master
      Services Agreement, Terms of Services, and other Sphere policies.
    </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>9.9. Assignment</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">

    <p class="my-6 ml-4"><strong>9.10. Modifications</strong> </p>
    <p class="my-6 ml-8">
      As noted previously, these Terms may be amended by Sphere from time to
      time in its sole discretion, with amendments becoming effective upon their
      posting to the Sphere website. User’s continued use of the Sphere Services
